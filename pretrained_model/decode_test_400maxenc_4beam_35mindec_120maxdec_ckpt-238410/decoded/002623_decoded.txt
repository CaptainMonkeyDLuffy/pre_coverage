the wedding of the year in scotland takes place on saturday when british no 1 and two-time grand slam champion andy murray marries kim sears , his girlfriend of almost 10 years , in his hometown of dunblane .
the couple got back together in 2010 following a brief split and after having to field constant questions over the years on when he would propose , their engagement was confirmed last november .
murray and sears attend the exhibition match held to mark the launch of the new wimbledon centre court roof in may 2009 .
