passengers coming towards the end of a 15 night cruise became the unwitting pawns in a legal wrangle between a former crew member and the owners of the mv azores .
the ship had been set to leave lisbon at 7pm on tuesday night with its 489 passengers heading back to bristol avonmouth after a round-trip tour that took in la coruna in spain , the azores , and madeira .
but that was scuppered when lawyers slapped a court order on the ship over an ` unresolved ' and ` historic ' financial wrangle .
