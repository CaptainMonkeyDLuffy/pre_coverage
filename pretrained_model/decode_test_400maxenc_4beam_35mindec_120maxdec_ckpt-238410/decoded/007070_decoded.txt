feidin santana , 23 , is seen entering the scott family home on thursday .
santana has been hailed a hero for keeping his cellphone camera trained on officer michael slager as he fired eight shots at scott , 50 , in north charleston on saturday .
santana , a barber who is originally from the dominican republic , said he shared the footage because he wanted the family to know precisely how their son had died .
