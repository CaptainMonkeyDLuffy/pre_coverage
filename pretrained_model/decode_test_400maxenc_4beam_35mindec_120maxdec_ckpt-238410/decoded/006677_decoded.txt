town halls have failed to recalibrate some of the 100,000 ticket machines in the city .
in manchester , where 240 machines are still not upgraded , motorists without old-style coins must use # 1 and two 20p pieces for a typical # 1.25 hour 's parking .
the council also charges # 1.85 for an hour and a half and # 3.10 for two hours and 30 minutes .
