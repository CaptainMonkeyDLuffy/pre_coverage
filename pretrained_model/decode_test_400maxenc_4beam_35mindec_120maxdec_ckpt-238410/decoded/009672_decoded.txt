in the third part of our major good health series on dementia , we look at ways to help minimise the impact of these memory problems .
during deep sleep , brain waves move memories from the hippocampus - the area of the brain that is involved in short-term memory - to the prefrontal cortex at the front of the brain , where long-term memories are stored .
if this does n't happen , short-term memories get overwritten with new ones and the consequence is forgetfulness .
