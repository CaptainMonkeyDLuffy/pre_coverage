militants fighting for boko haram in west africa have released first images of terror activities since pledging allegiance to isis leader abu bakr al-baghdadi .
the release came as nigerian soldiers backed by warplanes invaded the islamist 's final stronghold in the country - the sambisa forest - in an effort to finally defeat the six-year-old insurgency .
earlier this year the group 's leader , abubakar shekau , released a video saying the group had pledged allegiance to isis .
