paleontologists have found bite marks on the fossilised skull of a juvenile daspletosaurus , which lived around 75 million years ago .
this is a myth that has grown up because for many years their fossil skeletons tended to be found on their own , researchers say .
at least half a dozen of the animals appear to have belonged to a single social group , including adults and juveniles .
