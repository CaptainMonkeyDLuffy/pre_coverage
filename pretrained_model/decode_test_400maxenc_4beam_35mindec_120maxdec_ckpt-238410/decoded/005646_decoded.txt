peter thurston , 80 , started building the unusual vessel while he was doing through a divorce .
the catamavan has an oven , fridge freezer , shower , toilet , double bed and two tables , and it is fitted with a small engine that reaches four knots .
hundreds of two-litre bottles fill the twin hulls , so the boat wo n't sink even if it gets a hole .
