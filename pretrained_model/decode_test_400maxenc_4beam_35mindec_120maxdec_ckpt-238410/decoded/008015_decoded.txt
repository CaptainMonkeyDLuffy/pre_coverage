google announced to yahoo finance in a statement that its current policy changed .
this is good news for people who place large amounts of money in their wallet balance because the federal deposit insurance corporation insures funds for banking institutions up to $ 250,000 .
currently , google 's user agreement says funds are not protected by the fdic .
as a non-banking institution , google wallet , along with paypal and venmo , is not legally required to be federally insured .
