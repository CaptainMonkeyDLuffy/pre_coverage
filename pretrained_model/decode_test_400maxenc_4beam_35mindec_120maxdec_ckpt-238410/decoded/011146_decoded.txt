maría jose carrascosa , a 49-year-old native of spain , was released from jail friday night .
carrascosa , formerly of fort lee , was paroled last year after moving her daughter , then 5 , to spain when the girl 's father , peter innes , was granted custody of the child .
once paroled , carrascosa was taken to the bergen county jail for contempt of court for violating a court order to bring the child back .
