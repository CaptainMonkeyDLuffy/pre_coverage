the property , in the leafy south east london suburb of chislehurst , was designed and built especially for government officials as the cold war bunker .
the site was chosen because the wooden area surrounding the building afforded it secrecy and the house was built with five foot thick concrete walls .
the house was first built as a place where government officials could sit out a nuclear winter but now has a stunning atrium and a magnificent glass staircase .
