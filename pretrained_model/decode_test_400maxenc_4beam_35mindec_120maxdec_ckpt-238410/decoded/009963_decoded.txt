sasha , 14 , was spotted with white earbuds in her ears as she , sister malia and their parents ditched the white house - and the press pool - for an impromptu trip to great falls park in virginia on sunday .
the unscheduled trip came after the white house had sent reporters home for the day , sending the presidential press pool into a temporary tumult about where president obama and the first family had gone .
despite the earbuds , the teenage sasah and her older sister malia seemed to enjoy their time outdoors with their parents .
