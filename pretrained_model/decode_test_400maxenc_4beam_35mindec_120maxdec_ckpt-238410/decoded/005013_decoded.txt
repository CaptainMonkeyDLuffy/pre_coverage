islamic state militants infiltrated a palestinian refugee camp in damascus .
the militants , who already control large swaths of territory in northern syria , reportedly entered the camp from the nearby hajar aswad neighborhood in southern damascus in a coordinated attack with their rivals in the al qaeda-affiliated nusra front .
if isis manage to gain full control of yarmouk , the jihadis can potentially use the camp as a base from which to threaten the heart of the capital as possibly challenge assad himself .
