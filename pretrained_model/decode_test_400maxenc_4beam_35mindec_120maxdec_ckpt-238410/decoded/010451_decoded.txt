janet and john brennan spent eight years and hundreds of thousands of pounds turning barholm castle , in dumfries and galloway .
they bought the 15th century fort , reputed to have been used by leader of the scottish protestant reformation as a hiding place , for just # 65,000 .
but now it is on the market for offers over # 695,000 even though at that price the couple will lose a six-figure sum .
however , despite that , janet , 60 , and john , 64 , insist the project was a ` labour of love '
