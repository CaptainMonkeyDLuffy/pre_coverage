admiral kuznetsov , the country 's largest aircraft carrier , came up with the novel idea to help keep the deck clear of debris which poses a major risk to jet planes taking off and landing .
debris on carrier decks can potentially get sucked into jet engines .
usually crew members are forced to go around manually checking for stray objects , using sweeper vehicles to help tidy them up .
