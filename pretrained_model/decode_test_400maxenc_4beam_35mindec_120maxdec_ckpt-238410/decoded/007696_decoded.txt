snp leader nicola sturgeon has left her boxy jackets and severe suits in the past - and she proved her new style credentials with a stunning appearance yesterday morning .
the 44-year-old looked particularly glamorous on her way to bbc 's andrew marr show in a fuchsia column dress that flattered her slimmed-down physique .
miss sturgeon 's new look is a world away from her appearance in 2010 when she modelled clothes made from blankets in a charity event .
