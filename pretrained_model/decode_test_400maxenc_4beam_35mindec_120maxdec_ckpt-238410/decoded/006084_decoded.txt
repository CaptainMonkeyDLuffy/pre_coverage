president barack obama put a human face on the harmful effects climate change can have on public health - his daughter malia .
while making the case that higher temperatures lead to increases in wildfires , which send allergy-causing particulates into the air that can lead to greater and more serious incidents of asthma , the president recalled his own child 's run-in with the disease as a toddler .
` well you know , malia had asthma when she was four , and because we had good health insurance , we were able to knock it out early , ' the president said .
