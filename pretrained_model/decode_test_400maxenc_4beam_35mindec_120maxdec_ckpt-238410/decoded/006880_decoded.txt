marilyn zuniga , a teacher at forest street school in orange , new jersey , assigned her third-grade class to write ` get well ' letters to a sick inmate convicted of killing a philadelphia police officer .
preliminary inquiries found that zuniga did not seek approval from administrators nor were parents notified .
the letters were delivered to mumia abu-jamal in prison following his hospitalization last month for what his family said was treatment for complications from diabetes .
