the neurosurgeon , who is in kathmandu to cover the aftermath of saturday 's earthquake , performed a craniotomy on the 15-year-old girl , sandhya chalise , after a wall of her family 's home fell on her as she collected water outside .
sandhya , who lives in a more remote area of the country , only reached kathmandu 's bir hospital two days after the 7.8-magnitude quake .
