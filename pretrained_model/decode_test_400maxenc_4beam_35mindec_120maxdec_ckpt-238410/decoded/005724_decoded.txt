six-month-old had fallen from a building in zetland , inner-east of sydney , last month .
it was taken in by a local vet clinic , my vet animal hospital , who shared the story of aptly-named ` seven ' on social media .
since then , the cat has won the hearts of many who have donated funds to help pay for the hefty medical bills and surgeries .
