curt almond , 26 , from bristol , spent at least # 40 a week buying new calvin klein boxers so that he could slip into a new ` crisp pair ' every day of the week .
but after wiping out most of his savings , mr almond realised it was ` bankruptcy or boxers ' - and that he needed to wean himself off his addiction .
he has now reverted back to the normal routine of wearing and washing his boxers several times over .
