teresa james , 40 , pushed food longingly around her plate , desperate to eat but unable to stand the pain it would cause .
her mouth felt as if it were on fire , her gums were beginning to blister and her teeth had grown so sensitive that she knew that if so much as a sip of water came into contact with them she would wince .
