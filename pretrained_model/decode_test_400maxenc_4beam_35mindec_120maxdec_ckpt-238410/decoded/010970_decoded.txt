dr adrian quarterman has suggested space lasers could be used to power homes in the future .
the satellites will orbit the earth , covered in mirrors to help it harvest the sunlight and convert it into laser light .
the energy it then creates , using semi-conductors , can be shot back down to earth .
if it works , it could mean solar power could become viable in scotland .
