ryan giggs has been van gaal 's assistant since the dutchman took over at old trafford last summer .
the former united midfielder had a spell in temporary charge of the 20-time english champions after the dismissal of david moyes last season and van gaal believes the welshman would be the natural choice to succeed him .
van gaal has previously likened giggs to his own former assistant jose mourinho .
