the 19-time champion jockey has ridden him three times before .
he was second at the 2014 cheltenham festival and then landed the four-mile national hunt chase at last month 's meeting .
his four mile cheltenham win indicates reserves of stamina for the four-and-a-half-mile , 30-fence test which i like to see in my grand national hopes .
shutthefrontdoor , the 2014 irish national winner , is also strong on that score .
